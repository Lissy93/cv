## Motive
To automate my CV generation, and make it easier to maintain.
All content defined in YAML, then a script generates a LaTeX PDF and deploy a web version.
I did it this way so that I don't need to f\*\*k around with Microsoft Word.

<details>
  <summary>Motive (legacy)</summary>


> **Backstory**<br>
> I'm just about to be made redundant üò¢ (Aug '24), which I am gutted about. I've never been laid off before, and I loved my job and the people I worked with. So I'm now on the market, looking for a new role!
>
> I've kept my CV/resume **very** brief, in an attempt respect the hiring manager's time. But in short, I'm an experienced, Principle-level full stack engineer with a love for quality, performance, mentoring, tech and open source. The best judge of a developer is their code, and while I cannot share what I've done professional or for private clients, I have got many open source projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/lissy93) and at [apps.aliciasykes.com](https://apps.aliciasykes.com).

## About

The resume content is defined in [`resume.yml`](/resume.yml) following the [jsonresume.org](https://jsonresume.org/) standard, and validated against [`schema.json`](/schema.json).
A LaTex document is then generated from [`template.jinja`](/template.jinja) formated with [`resume-format.cls`](/tex/resume-format.cls), which is then [compiled into a PDF](https://github.com/Lissy93/cv/actions/workflows/compile.yml) by GitHub Actions, and published under the [Releases](https://github.com/Lissy93/cv/releases) tab.
A markdown version is also generated by [`lib/markdown.py`](/lib/markdown.py), as well as a CV website which is built as a static site with SvelteKit, and deployed to GitHub Pages and Vercel, at [cv.aliciasykes.com](https://aliciasykes.com).

Why? ...Because why spend 30 minutes writing your CV, when you could spend 30 hours automating it, obviously!

## Usage

### Option #1 - GitHub
1. Fork the repo
2. Update resume.json with your own content
3. Create [a tag](/.github/workflows/tag.yml), or trigger the GH actions workflow
4. ....and a PDF and website gets magically generated
5. View the PDF in the [Releases](https://github.com/Lissy93/cv/releases) tab, and the website source in the [`website`](https://github.com/Lissy93/cv/tree/website) branch, or deployed to GitHub Pages (for me, this is [cv.aliciasykes.com](https://cv.aliciasykes.com))

---

### Option #2 - Local
See the [`Makefile`](/Makefile) for all the available commands. Or, just run `make` from the root, to install deps, validate content, generate LaTex, and compile PDF

1. Clone the repo
2. Update resume.json with your own content
1. Run `make` from the root, to install deps, validate content, generate LaTex, and compile PDF

Or, to deploy the web version
1. Follow steps above (clone, edit, validate)
2. Run `make web` to generate `dist/`
3. upload to any CDN, web server or static hosting provider (I use Vercel)

<details><summary>Commands</summary>

- `make install` - Download dependencies
- `make validate` - Validate content
- `make generate` - Generate LaTex
- `make compile` - Compile PDF
- `make clean` - Remove generated files
- `make watch` - Watch for changes, recompile and refresh

## Editing
Modify data by editing [`resume.yml`](/resume.yml)<br>
If you need to customize the layout, edit [`template.jinja`](/template.jinja)<br>
Or to change the styles and formatting, edit [`resume-format.cls`](/tex/resume-format.cls)<br>
All the scripts used to generate output are located in [`lib/`](/lib/)<br>
These are triggered either by the [`Makefile`](/Makefile) or via GitHub Actions with the [`workflows/`](/.github/workflows)<br>
The source for the website version is located in [`web/`](/web)
