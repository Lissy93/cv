personal-statement: |
  I'm a builder at heart. I care about clean, simple software that's fast,
  secure, accessible—and actually helps people.
  Over the years, I've led teams, shipped products used by millions,
  modernised ageing systems, and helped engineers grow.
  I believe in open source, protecting user privacy, and leaving things better
  than I found them.
  I like working with kind, curious people who want to do great work and have a
  little fun along the way.
